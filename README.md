##Resources
I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

##Notes
It was a challenging project that I enjoyed. Had issues with the last list item for swatches wrapping into the second line when all widths were set to 100%. I had to try several times to get the media queries just right. Also, I had to change the original fonts I had because Google Fonts were easier to work with. I tried really hard to make this project responsive.
